# Amazon Clone

This is a small clone of the Amazon website.

## Production Link

https://clone-269c4.web.app

## Motivation

When deciding on a new project, I often have issues deciding what to do. I was looking to develop some of my front-end skills, and couldn't come up with something completely original. I remembered reading somewhere that cloning websites can sometimes be good practice, so I wanted to give it a shot.

## Tech Stack

Node.js, Javascript, React, Firebase, Axios, HTML, CSS

## Known Bugs

- Currently, the cart total of $144.98 throws and error to stripe. It gets translated as 14498.000000000002 instead of a whole number for some reason.

## Planned Updates
- Add a database of products
- Implement product search functionality
- Add an individual product page
